
cforms supports WP localization.

Please pick the appropriate language file from the /languages/ folder and copy it 
into your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

If your WP_LANG variable is set correctly (wp-config.php) then the language file
should be picked up immediately.


Note:

If you have suggestions or corrections, please get in touch with the actual author
of the translation file (see list below).
